Game Review
===========
Parses a single .slp file and outputs a structured analysis across 5 categories:
  1. Tech Skill       - L-cancel, wavedash, frame-1 aerials, aerial height split
  2. Stage Control    - % of time in center stage
  3. Edgeguarding     - above/below ledge conversion rates
  4. Neutral          - crouch vs shield time
  5. Punish           - avg damage, kill/edgeguard/reset outcomes

Usage:
